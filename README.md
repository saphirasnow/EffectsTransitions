# EffectsTransitions
Effects and transitions I've made for my AMVs.

## Transitions
### Feathered:
Wipe: Wipe at any angle across the screen.  
Circular Iris: The image is revealed as a circular hole grows in the center of the frame.  
Midsweep: Windshield wipe from the top of the frame. (note: reccommended smaller feather value than the others!)  
Halfwidth Wipe: Perform the wipe from opposite directions, splitting the frame in half.  

### Not Feathered:
Fade: Straightforward fade from one image to another.  
Moving Checkerboard: The transition occurs through a moving checkerboard pattern.  

## Effects
Grayscale: Removes color from a series of images. 
Not-Green Screen: In-progress effort to achieve a green screen effect without the use of a green screen.
